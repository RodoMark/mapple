# MAPPLE
=========

Mapple is a mulitpage, full-stack app, that saves and manages maps and map locations with tags for a user. Maps are orgainzed by interest and can be edited, organized, and favorited.

## Getting Started

1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Update the .env file with your correct local information 
  - username: `labber2` 
  - password: `labber2` 
  - database: `midterm`
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
5. In `psql`, run the command `CREATE ROLE labber2 WITH SUPERUSER LOGIN PASSWORD 'labber2';`
6. Create the database: `CREATE DATABASE midterm`
7. Install the table schema with `\i db/schema/01_schema.sql`
  - Then seed the database tables, in the following order:
      - `\i db/seeds/01_users.sql`
      - `\i db/seeds/02_interests`
      - `\i db/seeds/03_mapss.sql`
      - `\i db/seeds/04_maps.sql`
      - `\i db/seeds/05_maps.sql`
    - Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB

  - Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB
8. Run the server: `npm run local`
  - Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server
9. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`
- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with `users.js` and `widgets.js`
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See `db` folder for pre-populated examples. 
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds. 
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database. 
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.
